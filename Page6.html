            <h2>Part 1: STL Modification</h2>
            <p>This part of the project involved modifying the mesh of two STL files to produce a single printable STL. The objective was to ensure the final STL is suitable for rapid prototyping, passing all necessary checks in Rhino.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: Lamp Design</h2>
            <p>I designed a lamp that can be assembled and disassembled around its inner workings without the use of permanent fasteners. The design was influenced by considerations for a domestic setting, ensuring stability and ease of use. I am also going to use a rechargable lamp. This inspriation for this lamp will come from Bauhaus structures and design. I wanted it to be collapsable flat because I want to be able to carry it back to India without taking much space and damage. One inpiration is available below. </p>

            <p>This image shows my initial designs and some of the digital fabrication techniques used. I screwed up because I didnt accomadate for the holder for the bulb and just measured the bulb. </p>
