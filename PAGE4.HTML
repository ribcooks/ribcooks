            <p>Below is the process and final results of the cylinders print
                Cylinder 1 is the one double seam extrusion. It came out messy and I didnt get the dimensions right. The width was 5cm and the height was 2cm. It took 21 minutes to print. 
                Cylinder 2 is the spiralized one. The dimensions were accurate. It took 18 minutes to print. 
                Cylinder 3 is the one with single extrusion. It was accurately printed with 3cm diameter. It took 12 minutes to print. 
                Cylinder 4 is the one I printed sideways. It was difficult to break out. It came out accurately. It took 24 minutes to print.

            <h2>Cardboard Clip</h2>
            <p>A clip designed to hold together two pieces of cardboard:
                The first clip I designed didnt accomadate for the width of the cardboard at all and just printed the shape. I adjusted the height of the clip to 2.4mm to hold a cardboard together.
