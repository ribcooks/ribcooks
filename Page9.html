            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We started with an idea to make it easy to explain hyperlocal composting and its advantages for our sponsors, R2G. The goal was to create an engaging and accessible physical model that could transcend language barriers and be understood by people of all ages. After considering various options, we decided to build a marble run to visually demonstrate the relative impact of throwing food scraps into different bins.</p>

            <h2>Initial Concept and Prototyping</h2>
            <p>The journey began with brainstorming sessions and sketching initial concepts. We aimed to design a model that would be intuitive and compelling. The first prototype was a simple, rough model made from basic materials to test the core idea and mechanics. This early stage helped us identify key challenges and areas for improvement.</p>

            <h2>Design Evolution and Software Utilization</h2>
            <p>Our design evolved through multiple iterations, each version improving upon the last. We utilized a range of design software to refine our model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rhino:</strong> For precise 3D modeling and detailed design work.</li>
                <li><strong>SolidWorks:</strong> To create and test mechanical parts and ensure structural integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Cuttle:</strong> For laser cutting designs and intricate patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Illustrator:</strong> For graphic elements and visual enhancements.</li>
                <li><strong>Figma:</strong> For collaborative design and user interface planning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fabrication Methods</h2>
            <p>To bring our digital designs to life, we employed various fabrication methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laser-Cutting:</strong> This technique was used to create precise and intricate parts from different materials, ensuring a clean and professional finish.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Printing:</strong> Essential for producing custom components and parts that required specific shapes and sizes. It allowed for rapid prototyping and testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Gluing:</strong> Provided the necessary strength and stability to the model. It was crucial for assembling parts that required strong, durable bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>Clips and Fasteners:</strong> These were integrated to make the model easy to dismantle and carry. The use of clips ensured that the model could be assembled and disassembled quickly, enhancing its portability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Assembly and Portability</h2>
            <p>One of our key goals was to make the model user-friendly and portable. The final design allows a single person to disassemble and assemble the model in just 2 minutes. The components can be easily packed into a bag, making transportation convenient. This feature ensures that the model can be used in various settings and locations without hassle.</p>

            <h2>Adaptability and Broader Application</h2>
            <p>While the initial focus was on explaining the waste management process in Seattle, the model was designed with adaptability in mind. It can be modified to represent trash journeys across different geographies, making it a versatile educational tool for various audiences and contexts.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The creation of the R2G Marble Run model was a journey of continuous improvement and learning. From the initial concept to the final, portable model, each step was driven by the goal of making hyperlocal composting easy to understand and impactful for our audience. Through the use of advanced design software, innovative fabrication techniques, and thoughtful design, we succeeded in creating a powerful educational tool that bridges the gap between complex concepts and everyday understanding.</p>
