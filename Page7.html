To make the images appear smaller and more appropriate for viewing on a laptop screen, you can add some styling to your HTML code. Here's an updated version with smaller images:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Final Lamp Showcase</title>
    <style>
        img {
            max-width: 50%;
            height: auto;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Final Lamp</h1>
    <p>Here are the images of my final lamp created for the assignment:</p>
    <img src="Finallamp.jpg" alt="Lamp Image 1">
    <img src="Finallamp2.jpg" alt="Lamp Image 2">
    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>I used Rhino and Grasshopper to write the code for my lamp. Unfortunately, the size of the lamp shade came out wrong, but the design was quite nice. Additionally, my lamp is not fitting right, but it works, so it's a half win!</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Importance of accurate measurements for 3D printing</li>
        <li>Testing prototypes before final assembly</li>
        <li>Considering functional aspects along with design</li>
        <li>Adapting to unforeseen challenges and finding solutions</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In this updated code, the `<style>` block is used to apply styling to all `<img>` elements, setting the maximum width to 50% of the viewport width. You can adjust the `max-width` value to make the images smaller or larger as needed.
